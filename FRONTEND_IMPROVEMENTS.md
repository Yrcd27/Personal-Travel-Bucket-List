## 📝 Hero Image Setup

**IMPORTANT:** Save your provided architectural image as:
```
frontend/public/assets/hero-bg.jpg
```

The image will be used as the background for the landing page hero section with:
- Parallax effect
- Gradient overlay
- Opacity adjustment for text readability

If you don't have the image yet:
1. Save any travel/architecture image as `hero-bg.jpg` in that location
2. Or use a placeholder from Unsplash
3. Or temporarily remove the background image style from `Landing.jsx`

## 🚀 How to Test the Changes

### Option 1: With Docker (Full Stack)
```powershell
docker compose up
```
Then open http://localhost:5173

### Option 2: Frontend Only (Fastest for UI testing)
```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
Then open http://localhost:5173

## 🔄 Changes That Don't Require Docker Rebuild

Since the frontend is mounted as a volume in Docker, you can edit these files without rebuilding:
- All `.jsx` files (React components)
- All `.css` files (styles)
- All files in `src/` folder

Changes hot-reload automatically via Vite!

## 📦 What's Still Using Frontend Basics

The destination data is currently stored in **localStorage** (client-side). To upgrade to a backend API:

1. Add backend routes in `backend/src/routes/` (e.g., `destinations.js`)
2. Add destinations table to `db/init.sql`
3. Update `Dashboard.jsx` to use API calls instead of localStorage

Example structure for future backend:
```javascript
// API endpoints to add:
GET    /api/destinations       // Get all user destinations
POST   /api/destinations       // Create new destination
PUT    /api/destinations/:id   // Update destination
DELETE /api/destinations/:id   // Delete destination
PATCH  /api/destinations/:id/visited  // Toggle visited status
```

## 🎨 Color Palette Used

- **Primary Blue:** `#2563eb` to `#1d4ed8` (gradients)
- **Success Green:** `#10b981` to `#059669`
- **Warning Amber:** `#f59e0b` to `#d97706`
- **Danger Red:** `#ef4444` to `#dc2626`
- **Neutral Gray:** `#6b7280` to `#111827`

## 🔧 Technology Stack

- **React 19** with hooks
- **React Router DOM 7** for routing
- **Tailwind CSS 4** for styling
- **Vite 7** for dev server and hot reload
- **Axios** for API calls
- **LocalStorage** for data persistence (temporary)

## ✨ Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Backend Integration:** Convert localStorage to backend API
2. **Image Uploads:** Allow users to upload destination photos
3. **Date Tracking:** Add visit dates and trip planning
4. **Categories:** Group destinations by continent/region
5. **Sharing:** Share bucket list with friends
